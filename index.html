            <h2>Food for a Family</h2>
            <p>The primary focus of food waste prevention should be to act directly at source by limiting the generation of surplus food at each stage in the food supply chain (i.e. production, processing, distribution and consumption).</p>

            <p>Here are worthwhile organizations that can put those donations to use where they're needed. I've also provided a list of organizations that are already receiving attention but don't need the money they receive. By all means feel free to remember them but give where it's truly needed!</p>

            <p>Donations help pay for emergency relief and see people through crises. While many people donate in times of urgency, donations during the rest of the year are important, too. That's because many organizations focus on long-term solutions that address the root of issues like poverty. Experts say that healthcare and education programs are essential.</p>
